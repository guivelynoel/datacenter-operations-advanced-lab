# Build Notes

## Day 0
- Prepared VirtualBox networks: Host-only Mgmt + Internal Prod

## Day 1
- Created DC-Node-01 and DC-Node-02 on VirtualBox (macOS host)
- Installed latest Ubuntu Server on both nodes
- Enabled OpenSSH during installation
- Updated system packages
- Verified SSH service is running

## Day 2
- Configured dual network interfaces on both virtual machines
- Assigned Adapter 1 as Host-only Network for management traffic
- Assigned Adapter 2 as Internal Network (prod-net) for production traffic
- Created Host-only Network globally in VirtualBox (macOS requirement)
- Resolved invalid VM network configuration caused by missing host-only network
- Verified both NICs detected by Ubuntu using `ip a`
- Confirmed interfaces are up and ready for static IP assignment


## Day 3
- Identified correct Netplan configuration file based on Ubuntu version
- Configured static IP addresses for management and production NICs on both nodes
- Disabled DHCP on all interfaces
- Secured Netplan configuration file permissions
- Applied network changes safely using `netplan try` and `netplan apply`
- Verified correct IP assignment using `ip a`
- Validated connectivity between nodes on both management and production networks


## Day 4
- Hardened SSH configuration on both nodes
- Restricted SSH access to management network
- Identified systemd socket activation behavior on Ubuntu 24.04
- Reloaded systemd units and restarted ssh.socket to apply changes
- Validated SSH isolation using ss command




- Temporarily enabled NAT adapter to allow package updates
- Confirmed internet access for maintenance tasks
- Removed NAT adapter after updates to preserve isolation
